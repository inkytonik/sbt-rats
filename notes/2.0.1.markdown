This is a major release of the
[sbt-rats plugin](https://code.google.com/p/sbt-rats/). The main function of the
plugin to support the use of the
[Rats! parser generator](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/rats-intro.html)
with Scala is preserved and updated to work with modern versions of
sbt.

In addition, the plugin now supports a simpler high-level syntax description
format that can be automatically translated into Rats! specifications and
implementations of abstract syntax trees and pretty printers for those trees.

Please see the
[usage page on the project wiki](https://code.google.com/p/sbt-rats/wiki/Usage)
for all the details.

* The plugin is now based on Rats! version 2.3.1.

* The plugin is now part of the 
[sbt Community Plugins](http://www.scala-sbt.org/community-plugins.html)
collection.
