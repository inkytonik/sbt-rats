This release of the sbt-rats plugin contains the following changes.

### Fixes

* Fixed bug in handling of literals whereby a literal that was a prefix of a longer literal could not be parsed in some circumstances. E.g., if both "]" and "]]" are literals then the input "]]" would only ever be parsed as a "]]" not two "]" literals.

* Fixed bug where pretty-printing directives were confusing detection of recursive productions.

* Make processing of literals and escape sequences in literals more robust.

* Don't include a literal symbol more than once in a symbol production.

### Improvements

* Don't always import things from Kiama since if they are unused and unused import warnings/errors are on we can get spurious warnings/errors in generated code.

* Stronger type-checking of rules to avoid compilation errors in generated code.
