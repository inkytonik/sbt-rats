This release of the sbt-rats plugin is primarily a bug fix release with some improvements and cross-publishing support.

The plugin is now published as an auto-plugin for both sbt 0.13 and sbt 1.x. As a result, adding `sbtRatsSettings` to your build is no longer required. Users of previous versions should remove this manual setting inclusion.

### Improvements

* Stronger type-checking of rules to avoid more compilation errors in generated code.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug in handling of literals whereby a literal that was a prefix of a longer literal could not be parsed in some circumstances. E.g., if both "]" and "]]" are literals then the input "]]" would only ever be parsed as a "]]" not two "]" literals.

* Fixed a bug where pretty-printing directives were confusing detection of recursive productions.

* Make processing of literals and escape sequences in literals more robust.

* Don't include a literal symbol more than once in a symbol production.

* Properly disregard pretty-printing directives when detecting recursive productions.

* Don't always import things from Kiama since if they are unused and unused import warnings/errors are on we get spurious warnings/errors in generated code.
