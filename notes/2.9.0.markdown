This release of the sbt-rats plugin is a bug fix release.

## Fixes

* Improved correctness of finishing coordinates associated with parsed values when using Kiama. Previously we just used the current parse position, which wasn't correct if back-tracking happens. Now we use the most recent result with trailing whitespace ignored.
