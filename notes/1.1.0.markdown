This is the first public release of sbt-rats, a plugin that enables
you to use the [Rats! parser
generator](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/rats.html) with Scala projects
that are built using the
[simple-buld-tool](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool).

sbt-rats provides

  * a `rats` sbt action for generating parsers from Rats! specifications

For more information, see the project site
[http://sbt-rats.googlecode.com](http://sbt-rats.googlecode.com).

This release adds
  
  * support for Scala linked lists and positions, instead of Rats!-specific ones
