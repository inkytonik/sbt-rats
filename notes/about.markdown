[sbt-rats](http://sbt-rats.googlecode.com) is a
[simple-buld-tool](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/) plugin
that enables you to use the
[Rats! parser generator](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/rats-intro.html) in
Scala projects. It also has support for generating abstract
syntax tree structures and pretty printers from syntax descriptions.
