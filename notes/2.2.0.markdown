This is a release of the sbt-rats plugin containing the following main
changes:

* More than one syntax file can now be included in a project.

* A body section can be included as in Rats! specifications.

* Non-terminals can have type `Void` which means they are parsed as
for `String` non-terminals but the resulting value is discarded.

* New separated list constructs `**` and `++`. E.g., `a ** b` parses
a sequence of zero or more `a`'s separated by `b`'s. The plus form
requires at least one `a`.

* The ratsVerboseOutput plugin option has been removed in favour of new
support for including Rats! options in syntax files (just verbose and
setOfString options for now).

* New ratsIncludeKeywordTable option (default true) and
ratsIncludeBinarySupport option (default false).

* Moved to sbt 0.13.6 and target Scala 2.11.2 and Kiama 1.7.0.

* A number of other bug fixes and improvements to generated code.
