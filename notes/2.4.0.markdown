This release of the sbt-rats plugin contains the following changes:

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused bad pretty-printing code to be generated for a recursive non-terminal unless parenthesized pretty-printing was enabled.

* Fixed a bug that caused the generated parser not to compile when the verbose option was used.

* Fix bugs in generated code if the syntax spec only contains String-valued non-terminals.
