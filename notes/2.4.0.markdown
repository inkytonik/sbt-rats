This release of the sbt-rats plugin contains the following changes:

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused bad pretty-printing code to be generated for a recursive non-terminal unless parenthesized pretty-printing was enabled.

* Fixed a bug that caused the generated parser not to compile when the verbose option was used.

* Fix bugs in generated code if the syntax spec only contains String-valued non-terminals.

* Protect against Rats! errors that don't have a corresponding location. In some circumstances, including when a `String`-valued production has an unreachable alternative, Rats! will generate an error at a null location. `sbt-rats` previously would crash trying to access this location. We now generate an error saying that the location is unknown.
