sbt-rats provides a plugin that enables the Rats! parser generator to be used in Scala projects.

The plugin enables you to use the Rats! parser generator with Scala projects that are built using the Scala build tool sbt. The parser can be specified directly using a Rats! specification or using a simplified syntactic notation. The syntactic notation can also be translated into a Scala implementation of abstract syntax trees and a pretty printer for those trees. Pretty-printing support is provided by the Kiama language processing library.
